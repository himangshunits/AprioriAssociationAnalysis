Implentation of the Apriori algorithm to find the maximal frequent itemsets, then generate rules for apriori 
algorithm with minimum support min sup = 4% and min conf = 10%. Output your frequent itemsets to frequentitemsets.txt, 
and rules to rules.txt, in the same folder where it is run from.

NB : Parts of the code below uses ideas learnt from the above referrences.

Ruuning Instructions:

1. Please check the path above for loading the matrix and saving the outputs and set it to personal need.
	if the paths are not changed, then it searches for the transaction.mat in the current folder and also saves the output to current folder
    -> So if you are not already in the directory where you have put the transaction.mat, please navigate to that or change the paths !
2. Please enter in the form of python filename.py <minSup> <minConf> and run.
3. minSup should be the exact number, like if 4% of 1000 items, then minSup = 40
4. minConf should be a fraction, if 10%, then minConf = 0.1
5. Sample run command as per personal system
"/User/Himangshu/p03.py 40 0.1"


Sample path settings:
path = "/Users/Himangshu/Desktop/AprioriDataset/transaction.mat"
pathItemsets = "/Users/Himangshu/Desktop/AprioriDataset/frequentitemsets.txt"
pathRules = "/Users/Himangshu/Desktop/AprioriDataset/rules.txt"
